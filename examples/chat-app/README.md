# chat-app

Based on the [React chat-app example from Horizon.io](https://github.com/rethinkdb/horizon/tree/next/examples/react-chat-app).

## Running the example

You'll need Horizon installed first: `npm install -g horizon`

1. `git clone git@github.com:shanecav/horizon-redux.git`
2. `cd horizon-redux`
3. `npm install`
4. `cd examples/chat-app`
5. `npm install`
6. `hz init`
7. `hz serve --dev`
8. In a new terminal (at the same directory): `npm start`

Now you can view the chat-app example at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Play around with it to see how horizon-redux works! Try opening it in another browser window to see the realtime changes take effect.
