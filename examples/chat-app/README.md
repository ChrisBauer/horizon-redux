# chat-app

Based on the [React chat-app example from Horizon.io](https://github.com/rethinkdb/horizon/tree/next/examples/react-chat-app).

## Running the example

You'll need Horizon installed first: `npm install -g horizon`

1. Clone this repo, and `cd` into the examples/chat-app directory.
2. `npm install`
3. `hz init`
4. `hz serve --dev`
5. In a new terminal (at the same directory): `npm start`

Now you can view the chat-app example at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Play around with it to see how horizon-redux works! Try opening it in another browser window to see the realtime changes take effect.
